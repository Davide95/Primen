Primen
======
Primen is an educational software written in C# that implements prime factorization (using trial division)
with distributed computing (using MPI.NET)
and parallel computing (using System.Threading.Tasks).

For example Primen can factorize a product of two prime numbers in order to obtain an RSA private key from a public key.
